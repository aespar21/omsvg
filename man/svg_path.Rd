\title{Addition of an \code{path} element}
\usage{
svg_path(svg, path, stroke = "#000000", stroke_width = 1,
  fill = "#DDDDDD", opacity = 1, attrs = list(), anims = list(),
  id = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{svg}{The \code{svg} object that is created using the \code{\link[=SVG]{SVG()}} function.}

\item{path}{A single-length character vector that holds the formatted path
string.}

\item{stroke}{The color of the stroke applied to the element (i.e., the
outline). By default, this is \code{"#000000"} (black).}

\item{stroke_width}{The width of the stroke in units of pixels. By default,
this is \code{1.0}.}

\item{fill}{The fill color of the element. This is \code{"#DDDDDD"} by default.}

\item{opacity}{The initial opacity of the element. Must be a value in the
range of \code{0} to \code{1}. By default, the value is set to \code{1.0} (fully opaque).}

\item{attrs}{A presentation attribute list. The helper function
\code{\link[=attrs_pres]{attrs_pres()}} can help us easily generate this named list object. For the
most part, the list's names are the presentation attribute names and the
corresponding values are the matching attribute values.}

\item{anims}{An animation directive list for the element. This should be
structured using the \code{\link[=anims]{anims()}} function.}

\item{id}{An optional ID value to give to the built tag. This is useful for
modifying this element in a later function call or for interacting with
CSS.}
}
\description{
The \code{svg_path()} function adds a path to an \code{svg} object. A path can
potentially be quite complex (with an interplay of line and curve commands),
so, a hand-encoded \code{path} string is not often done by hand. For this reason,
the \code{path} argument accepts only a formatted string that complies with the
input requirements for the \code{d} attribute of the SVG \code{<path>} tag. All point
positions are in units of \code{px}.

\examples{
# Create an SVG with a single
# path element
svg <-
  SVG(width = 300, height = 300) \%>\%
    svg_path(
      path = "M 50 160 q 100 -300 200 0",
      stroke = "magenta",
      stroke_width = 5,
      fill = "lightblue"
    )
